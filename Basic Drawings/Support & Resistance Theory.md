In the simplest terms, **support** and **resistance** are key price levels where a stock or asset tends to stop moving in a certain direction.

### **Support**:
- This is the price level where the price tends to **stop falling** and may start rising again. Think of it like a "floor" for the price.
- When a stock or asset reaches this level, **buyers** are more likely to step in and start buying, which pushes the price back up.

### **Resistance**:
- This is the price level where the price tends to **stop rising** and may start falling again. Think of it like a "ceiling" for the price.
- When a stock or asset hits this level, **sellers** are more likely to step in and start selling, which pushes the price back down.

As a **day trader**, you use these levels to help decide when to enter or exit trades. For example:
- If the price is near **support**, you might consider buying, expecting the price to bounce back up.
- If the price is near **resistance**, you might consider selling, expecting the price to drop.

These levels are not always exact, but they give you a good idea of where price might turn around.











**Support:**
- Areas of demand. A price level where traders want to buy more shares. 
- Visually prices don't go LOWER than this level.

- Example: Every single time we come to this green line. 
- More buyer than sellers. 
- This is the level of support, and prices wont go lower.

**Supply and Demand and Value:**
- When supply is low and demand is high, that is a value assets and ask higher prices for the assets
- Same things hold true but in reverse for resistance.

**Support:**
Areas of demand. A price level where traders want to buy more shares. 
Visually prices dont go LOWER than this level
**Resistance:**
Ares of high supply, low demand. Want to sell. 
Visually prices dont go HIGHER than this level (the red line)

- Red line is our resistance 
- Every time price comes in, prices back off 
- More sellers than buyers 
- Supply is greater than demand 
- Resistance don't want to go higher than prices might be (red line)

# Three Key Steps To Drawing
- Pick the appropriate time frame your trade to draw levels. Always start on daily. 
- Draw levels with the most touches (data), go back and fine tune to maximize. 
- Use the zone effect to allow for wiggle room.
