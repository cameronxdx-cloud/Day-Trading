## Three Key Steps To Drawing
Pick the appropriate time frame for your trade to draw levels. 

Use the bottom or the top of a relevant move as the anchor point. 

Start using the swing out method for first touch and adjust from there.

# Super Support & Resistances 
Horizontal support or resistance that coincides with a trend line support or resistance.
