- **Trading Strategy:** Use Fibonacci levels and EMA indicators to find entry/exit points; avoid impulsive trades by planning carefully.
    
- **Asia Session Preference:** Favor trading during Asia for steadier price action and longer planning times, avoiding fast-paced New York session.
    
- **Risk Management:** Implement clear risk-reward strategies, aiming for at least 1:2 ratios; typical trade risks discussed were $50 for potential $100-200 gains.
    
- **Technical Tools:** Prioritize simplicity in indicators like Fibonacci and EMA; avoid complex tools that can distract from fundamental price action.
    
- **Community Support:** Emphasize the importance of mentorship and community for emotional support, especially in challenging trading environments.
    
- **Platform Recommendations:** Use TradingView app for enhanced order management; consider Black Friday discounts for premium features like backtesting tools.
    

  

**Notes**

## **Trading Strategy and Execution**

The core trading approach centers on using **Fibonacci retracement levels**, **EMA indicators (9, 21, and 50)**, and session-based price structure to identify high-probability entries and exits (20:07).

- **Van Williamson emphasized** using the **0.5 and 0.6 Fibonacci retracement levels** drawn from recent swing highs to swing lows on hourly charts for gold and NQ futures (24:30).
    
    - This method provides mathematical zones where price tends to stall or reverse, offering clearer entry points and targets.
        
    - Van’s style favors simple setups like breakouts and retests around these fib levels, avoiding scalping without a plan.
        
    - The 21 EMA is used as a dynamic support/resistance wick level, offering risk-managed entry and stop-loss placement.
        
    - This approach reduces emotional trading by quantifying risk/reward before entries, with stops generally placed just beyond recent swing wicks.
        
- **Cameron Dilger shared** difficulties transitioning from longer-term swing trading to scalping, noting a loss of patience and increasing impulsiveness leading to frequent stop-outs (36:24).
    
    - Van recommended focusing on trading during the Asia session for calmer, more predictable moves, allowing planned entries without rush.
        
    - Scale-out techniques were discussed, with Van preferring multiple smaller contracts in micros over single large contracts in minis to manage psychological risk better (23:51, 07:42).
        
- **Trade execution tools and platforms** were a point of discussion, with Van advocating for TradingView’s app for better order management and charting features, including drag-and-drop stop and take-profit orders (57:00, 16:03).
    
    - Cameron reported limitations on his funded futures platform preventing this flexibility, which Van identified as a disadvantage.
        
    - Van also recommended waiting for Black Friday to purchase TradingView premium at a discount, highlighting its value for backtesting and pattern recognition.
        
- **Risk management and trade planning** were stressed throughout, with an example risk-reward scenario having Cameron risk **$50 to make $100-200** per trade using fib levels and EMA stops (50:35).
    
    - Van insisted on waiting for price action confirmations before entering trades to avoid chasing and emotional losses (55:04).
        
    - Dynamic trailing stops and scaling out to secure profits while letting runners go were presented as key tactics to protect capital and maximize gains (06:15, 43:51).
        
- Van shared his mindset on losses as business expenses and encouraged acceptance of blown accounts as part of the learning curve, particularly for scalpers transitioning from longer-term styles (21:25).
    
    - He advised persistence over years to find a consistent style and cautioned against emotional decision-making.
        

## **Market Session Analysis and Timing**

Trading sessions and their unique behaviors impact strategy and risk tolerance, with a preference for slower sessions to plan trades and avoid impulsive decisions (44:19).

- Van prefers **Asia session trading** due to its steadier price action and longer planning windows, contrasting with the fast, volatile **New York session** that often causes premature exits and frustration (43:19, 44:35).
    
    - He advised setting alerts and focusing on key fib levels during Asia to avoid overtrading.
        
- The importance of mapping session opens, highs, and lows (e.g., **15-minute open range breakout**) on charts was highlighted as essential for intraday structure and trade context (59:12).
    
    - Van showed how to mark swing highs and lows on hourly and 5-minute charts to identify intraday support and resistance levels, guiding entry and exit targets (01:00:33, 01:35:50).
        
- Van explained how volume spikes and price action at session boundaries like Asia open, London open, and New York open serve as magnets or reversal zones, which traders can anticipate (47:14).
    
    - For NQ futures, he noted that price often sweeps Asia or London session extremes before the New York session volatility, allowing preparatory positioning (47:57).
        
- Cameron and Van struggled initially with charting session times across time zones, underscoring the need for proper TradingView settings and session indicators for precise analysis (33:38, 34:10, 40:05).
    

## **Technical Indicators and Charting Tools**

The discussion focused on selecting and configuring key technical tools that support the trading style with an emphasis on simplicity and clarity (50:54).

- Van relies primarily on **Fibonacci retracements**, **EMA (9, 21, 50)**, and price action reading rather than volume profile or complex indicators, which he finds noisy and distracting (55:10).
    
    - He sees the 9 EMA as representing immediate price action, 21 EMA as a bounce zone, and 50 EMA as a reversal warning.
        
- Cameron showed interest in volume profile indicators but struggles with complexity and platform limitations (25:44).
    
    - Van suggested that volume profile may provide additional context but is secondary to price structure and fib levels.
        
- Van demonstrated an advanced **Al Brooks indicator on TradingView** that signals bullish or bearish setups, recommended stop loss, and profit targets, but admitted relying mainly on his own judgement (51:45).
    
    - Cameron does not have access to this due to subscription limitations but expressed interest.
        
- Chart configuration tips included enabling fib levels to extend right on the chart, showing percentage labels, and marking session highs and lows for clear visual guidance (40:30).
    
- Van recommended using TradingView’s **bar replay feature** for backtesting and pattern recognition to build confidence and muscle memory (55:40).
    

## **Psychological and Community Support**

Both traders underscored the mental challenges of trading, especially for newer scalpers, and the value of community and one-on-one mentoring (17:36, 18:58).

- Van shared his own journey of years of trading, account blowouts, and evolving styles, emphasizing patience and acceptance of losses as part of the business (21:40).
    
    - He framed losses as business expenses and encouraged Cameron to persist through emotional struggles.
        
- Cameron expressed relief at having a supportive and like-minded community, noting loneliness in trading spaces dominated by toxic or non-inclusive environments (17:26).
    
    - They discussed the importance of having a safe space, particularly for trans and queer traders, to share strategies and emotional support.
        
- Van offered to share screenshots, templates, and educational materials to help Cameron develop his trading plan and reduce frustration (43:19, 35:28).
    
- The dialogue showed that verbalizing and planning trades aloud helps both traders clarify their thoughts and improve discipline (11:31, 53:39).
    

## **Product and Platform Recommendations**

The conversation included specific platform and product suggestions to improve trade execution and analysis efficiency (57:00, 01:24:11).

- **TradingView app** was recommended over web versions for better order management, including draggable stop loss and take profit orders, which Cameron’s current funded futures platform lacks (57:00).
    
- Van advised waiting for Black Friday to buy TradingView premium to get a substantial discount and extend the license duration based on unused months (55:43).
    
- Cameron’s funded futures platform limits his ability to drag orders or set stops efficiently, causing frustration and potential missed opportunities (56:58).
    
- Van uses micros contracts instead of minis or full contracts for better scaling and psychological comfort (23:51).
    
- Cameron mentioned using other indicators like anchored volume profile and “parts” but finds the complexity overwhelming, reinforcing Van’s preference for simplicity in indicators (25:44).
    

## **Trade Planning and Risk Management**

Trade management revolves around clear entry criteria, defined stop-loss levels, and scaling out profits to protect capital and optimize gains (50:35, 06:15).

- Van described planning trades with multiple scenarios (plan A, B, C, D) based on price action confirmation and fib level retests to avoid impulsive entries (53:37).
    
- Stop losses are placed just beyond recent candle wicks or EMA bounces to minimize getting wicked out prematurely (50:35).
    
- Proper risk-reward ratios of at least 1:2 or better are targeted, with examples of risking **$50 to make $100-200** per trade shared to maintain profitability (50:35).
    
- Scaling out contracts during runs and trailing stops to break even reduces risk and locks in profits, encouraging confidence in holding winning trades longer (06:15).
    
- Van cautioned against chasing trades or entering without a clear plan, as this leads to emotional losses and erodes confidence (55:04).
    
- The importance of studying price action, candle structure, and market context before committing to trades was emphasized repeatedly to improve decision-making (53:37, 01:46:42).
