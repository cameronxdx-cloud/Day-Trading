*Absorption* - a lot of activity that does not have a clear result in price. A lot of money, and volume inside a single tick or two to three ticks 
- In this case buyers

- In this example; sellers are trying to push price down, sellers were absorb and then had a follow through 
- 1.1k were absorbed and then they had a follow through

# Exhaustion
*Exhaustion* - is a phase where you see from a profile standpoint, a dry up in volume 
- Less and less volume towards the bottom 
- You don't have a clear phase or absorption towards the bottom 
- An attempt a dry up in sell volume and buyers taking the upper hand
- Sellers stopped accepting lower price at the same pace as aggressive buyers

# The difference 

- The difference between a phase of absorption where you have the passive participants blocking price from going up and then taking the upper hand. 
- When this happens in a way that aggressive selling that dries up without a clear wall from passive buyers, and then buyers taking the upper hand.

**Quick comparison:**

- **Absorption** = Strong hands stopping the move (defensive strength)
- **Exhaustion** = Weak hands giving up after overextending (offensive weakness)

Both can lead to reversals, but absorption shows strength building up, while exhaustion shows weakness burning out.
