- In this example; sellers are trying to push price down, sellers were absorb and then had a follow through

# Exhaustion
*Exhaustion* - is a phase where you see from a profile standpoint, a dry up in volume 
- Less and less volume towards the bottom 
- You dont have a clear phase or absorption towards the bottom 
- An attempt a dry up in sell volume and buyers taking the upper hand
- Sellers stopped accepting lower price at the same pace as aggressive buyers
