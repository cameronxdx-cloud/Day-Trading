## What is Order Flow?
- Order flow is the flow of buy and sell orders (supply and demand) in the market. It's a summary of market participants' decisions that shows how and why price did or will do something. It provides pure, raw trading data that reveals the deeper mechanics behind price movements.
- Gives a clear picture of who is dominating the market auction
## Why Use Order Flow?
- **Enhanced precision and informational edge** - Order flow gives you more powerful and precise tools. It's "candles on steroids" that provides an informational advantage over most traders.

- **Deeper market understanding** - Price is just the result (the words), but order flow is the root (the emotions and body language). It reveals the deeper layer of market language that cannot be understood through price alone.

- **See what's invisible to price action** - Order flow reveals crucial information like iceberg orders, institutional absorption, and momentum ignition that simply cannot be seen on regular candlestick charts.

- **Follow the big money** - Massive volume concentrations indicate institutional activity and algorithms getting filled, not retail traders. This helps you identify where smart money is operating.
