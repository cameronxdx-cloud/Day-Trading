A mathematical sequence that has applications in nature, music, and even programming. 

Two levels in particular (**61.8 and 38.2**) are known as the **golden ratios.**

Works on any time frame of analysis to identify levels of support and resistance.

Bullish -  100% Retracement means coming all the way back to the bottom 
If you fail/below 61.8

Bearish - 100% Retracement means coming all the way back to the top 

# Fibonacci Extensions 

Used to gauge moves that have not yet happened.

## Recap 

**Fibonacci Retracement** - Price levels that help gauge the strength, or lack there of, on pullbacks

**Fibonacci Extensions** - Price level predictions based on an existing move, to gauge targets when no historic data exists.
