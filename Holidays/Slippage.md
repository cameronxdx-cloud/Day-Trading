During normal trading days, the market works smoothly because of market makers. These are basically companies or big players who constantly stand ready to buy or sell at prices very close to the current price. Think of them as the “middlemen” who keep the buying and selling connected — they help match buyers and sellers quickly so prices don’t jump around too wildly.

But during holidays (like Christmas, Thanksgiving, or other major breaks), many of these market makers (and lots of other big traders) take time off. Fewer people are trading overall.

When that happens, the market gets “thin” (low liquidity = not many buyers and sellers around).

This causes two big problems:

1. The gap between the buy price (bid) and sell price (ask) gets much wider.
    
2. If someone wants to trade right away (using a market order), their order might have to “jump” over a big empty space to find the next available buyer or seller.
    

Slippage = when your trade actually happens at a worse price than you expected.

Super simple example (like the speaker used):

- You want to buy something.
    
- You see the price at $100 and place your buy order.
    
- Normally, a market maker would sell it to you quickly around $100–$101.
    
- But on a holiday with no market makers around…
    
    - The closest person actually willing to sell is at $125.
        
    - Your order jumps straight to $125 to get filled.
        
    - You just paid $25 more per share/unit than you expected → that’s bad slippage (25 points in this case).
        

The price can spike suddenly (up or down) because there aren’t enough “shock absorbers” (market makers) to keep things smooth. One decent-sized order can move the price a lot, and it can even trigger stop-losses or liquidate positions unexpectedly.

Bottom line advice (what the speaker meant):

Be extra careful trading during holidays. Prices can swing wildly and cost you more (or fill at terrible prices) because the usual helpers (market makers) aren’t there to keep things calm and orderly.

Many traders just sit out or trade much smaller during these periods to avoid nasty surprises.
