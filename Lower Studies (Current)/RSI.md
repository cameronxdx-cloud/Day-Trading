## Relative Strength Index 
- Measure and plots the difference in recent price changes to identify potentially overbought and oversold conditions. Constrained 0 - 100. 

- If RSI is less than 30 - Starting to get oversold. (Look for hammer candle)
- If RSI is more than 70 - Starting to get overbought. ( Look for inverted hammer candle)

- These are default settings; do you want extremes?
