## Relative Strength Index 
- Measure and plots the difference in recent price changes to identify potentially overbought and oversold conditions. Constrained 0 - 100. 

- If RSI is less than 30 - Starting to get oversold. (Look for hammer candle)
- If RSI is more than 70 - Starting to get overbought. ( Look for inverted hammer candle)

- These are default settings; do you want extremes? 
## Three Scenarios To Watch 
- 50 line cross: Is sentiment starting to shift? 

- Oversold <30 in up trend; Is this pullback running out of steam? Can bulls recover? (Look out for reversal candle)

- Overbought >70 in down trend: Is this bounce running out of steam? Can bears recover? (Look out for inverted hammer reversal candle)
