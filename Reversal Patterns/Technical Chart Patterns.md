Looks at groups of candle sticks as opposed to just one individual candle

Drawn with a combination of support, resistance and trend lines. 

Three types: Reversal, Continuation, Breakout

# Three Key Considerations 
*What is the current **trend** that the pattern is happening in? Going with the trend.* 
- Always important to establish the current trend 
- Go with the trend, makes trading easy 
- Stair case, easy going with people upstairs vs the one going downstairs against the grain. 

What type of candles are forming? 

What is happening with volume? 
Before, during, and after the pattern? 

# Reversal Patterns 
A sign that the current trend could change. 

If price is trending up; a new down trend could be the result. If trending down; a new up trend could be the result. 

Used to trade the reversal OR avoid new trades.  

## Double Top / Bottom
Most simple pattern for reversals. 

Price tests a prior support or resistance, and fails to break out / break down.

Pullback forms a **"neck line"** that provides confirmation for entry point.

*Double Top* 
- Known area of resistance 
- The pull back low on the first re-test of that resistance 
- Equal high (red line)
- Break of the neck line shows downward trend 

*Double Bottom*
- Support (green line)
- Bounce when we come into support 
- Equal low on the re test 
- Once it breaks the neckline, upward trend.

# Head and Shoulders / Inverted 
A more reliable version of the double top / bottom 

Involves ==**three== unequal highs or lows**, with the middle level being the highest / lowest.

Pullbacks form a "neck line" that provides confirmation for entry point.
