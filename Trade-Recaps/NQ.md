## Summary 

Alex Tilinca presented a top-down analysis and trading strategy, combining 
price volume and ICT trading styles, focusing on the volume profile to 
identify the value area and point of control for trade bias determination. 
Alex Tilinca established a strong bearish bias based on a significant gap 
and price exceeding yesterday's high upon market open, which led to two 
successful short trades utilizing "fade" and "unicorn" pattern setups, with 
trade management involving moving the stop loss to a risk-free position. 
Alex Tilinca utilized the cumulative volume delta (CVD) to confirm the 
selling pressure, exiting the second short trade near the value area low 
when the CVD stalled. 

## Details 

● Top-Down Analysis and Trading Strategy Alex Tilinca presented an explanation 
of their short trade bias and analysis using a combination of price volume and 
ICT trading styles. They initiated their analysis with the volume profile, which 
displays where price was traded in a singular day. Alex Tilinca noted that the area 
between the orange lines is the value area, where 70% of trading volume occurs, 
and the pink line is the point of control, where the highest volume is found and 
which acts as a price magnet. 

● Identifying a Short Bias Alex Tilinca established a bearish bias based on several 
factors, including a huge selling pressure due to a significant gap that price 
typically revisits before moving down. On the hourly chart, Alex Tilinca observed 
that upon market open, price had already surpassed yesterday’s high of day, 
which typically signals a reversal or retracement because the day's objective was 
already achieved. This observation, combined with opening at the extreme of the 
daily volume profile and general bearish sentiment from hedge funds, solidified 
their decision to look for shorts. 

● Trade Execution and Order Block Alex Tilinca noted that the price filled the 
observed gap and reached the perceived maximum upward movement, entering 
an order block—an area of consolidation that created a massive movement 
down. The overnight high was right at the extreme of this order block. The first 
trade entry was initiated when price closed underneath the value area high, which 
Alex Tilinca described as a "fade" setup, with the target being the point of control. 
The initial stop loss was placed above the overnight high, as a breach there 
would invalidate the short thesis. 

● Trade Management and Subsequent Trades Following the initial entry, Alex 
Tilinca observed buy orders being completely rejected, allowing them to move 
their stop loss to a risk-free position. Price started consolidating around the point 
of control, which Alex Tilinca personally dislikes trading. Alex Tilinca then 
discussed a potential long trade opportunity that was missed when price hit their 
demand zone, which was derived from previous massive rejection wicks on the 
hourly chart. They noted that this missed opportunity would have been a "good 
trade" upon retest of the value area low, confirming an upward movement. 
However, Alex Tilinca preferred to stick to their bearish bias, as the long would 
have been counter-trend. 

● Unicorn Pattern and Second Short Trade Alex Tilinca looked for another short 
opportunity as buyers were completely absorbed at the value area high. The 
second short signal was a "unicorn" pattern identified on both the range and 
hourly charts, which is a candle formation backed by price volume and price 
movement. The unicorn pattern includes a high-volume rejection at the extreme 
that is unable to form a higher high. Alex Tilinca entered the second short when 
massive sell orders came in, placing their stop loss aggressively above the 
overnight high. They exited this trade at the value area low, adhering to the 
expectation that price often stays within the range. 

● Cumulative Volume Delta Analysis Alex Tilinca used the cumulative volume delta 
(CVD) to confirm selling pressure, noting that a negative delta indicates more 
sellers than buyers. They observed the delta going down consistently, providing 
confidence in their short trades. Alex Tilinca exited the second trade as the CVD 
stalled near the value area low.
