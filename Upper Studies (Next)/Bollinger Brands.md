- Plots a range, based on the 20 SMA and two standard deviation of price above and blow that 20 period length. 
- Used to determine if a move in price is "normal" or starting to become overextended. 
- Can be support or resistance; Remember supers. 

## Riding and Squeeze 
- Price can "ride" the upper or lower bollinger band and still not "cool off"
- Is price **closing** above or below the UBB / LBB?
- When the bollinger bands start to squeeze, generally things are becoming range bound and a break out can be likely.
