 
# Moving Averages & Market Indicators

> ⚠️ **These are NOT buy and sell signals.**  
> Lagging indicators based on price action and volume — the core foundation of trading.  
> They can *help* confirm or deny the bias you develop.  
> Ask yourself: _What type of candles are forming?_

## 📊 Moving Averages

- Represents the **average price** over the past _X_ number of candles, on any timeframe.
- Used to **visualize trends** quickly.
- Can act as **support and resistance** levels.
- Two main types:
  - **Simple Moving Average (SMA)**
  - **Exponential Moving Average (EMA)**

---

## 🔱 Three Golden MA Lengths

These three are highly recommended and widely used:

- **Short-term**: 20 MA  
- **Medium-term**: 50 MA  
- **Long-term**: 200 MA

> 🧪 _Experiment with other lengths if you'd like, but these are regarded as the "gold standard."_

## 🧱 Moving Averages as Support & Resistance

- MAs tend to act as **support or resistance**, especially the golden standards (20, 50, 200).
- They become **super supports** when aligned with horizontal or trendline support.
- **The first touch** of a moving average is often the most significant.
