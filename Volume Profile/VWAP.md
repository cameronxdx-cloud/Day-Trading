VWAP stands for Volume Weighted Average Price. It's one of the most popular intraday tools (especially for day traders), and it pairs beautifully with the Anchored Volume Profile I've been learning about.

### Super Simple Explanation: What is VWAP?

VWAP is basically the **"average price"** the asset has traded at today — but weighted by **volume**. (Unlike a regular moving average that treats every price the same, VWAP gives more importance to prices where **lots of volume** happened.)

### How Traders Read VWAP (Easiest Way)

VWAP acts like a **dynamic fair value line** for the day:

- **Price ABOVE VWAP** → Bullish bias (buyers in control, average trader is profiting)
- **Price BELOW VWAP** → Bearish bias (sellers in control, average trader is losing)
- **Price hugging / chopping around VWAP** → Balanced / ranging market (no strong direction)

- Many pros (and institutions) use it as **support/resistance**:
- Pullback to VWAP from above → often bounces up (bullish support)
- Rally up to VWAP from below → often rejects down (bearish resistance)
