## General Trading Tips

- **Context Matters**: Patterns are more reliable when they appear at key levels (e.g., support/resistance, Fibonacci retracement levels).
- **Timeframes**: Patterns can be used on any timeframe, but higher timeframes (e.g., H4, D1) tend to produce more reliable signals.
- **Risk Management**: Use stop-loss orders and proper position sizing to protect against unexpected market moves.
- **Practice**: Test patterns in a demo account to understand their behavior in different market conditions.
